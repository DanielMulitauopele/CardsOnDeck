# CardsOnDeck

CardsOnDeck is a gem that allows for readily available Card and Deck functionality at the tip of your coding fingers. 'GemCard' instances have access to typical card attributes, such as suit, value, color, and name. Rank is also included for sorting heirarchies. 'GemDeck' instances function as regular decks do, with add, draw, and shuffle functionality, as well as the ability to auto-create standard decks that are ready for play!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'cards_on_deck'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install cards_on_deck
